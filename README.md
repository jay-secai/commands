# Commands Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the **Common-Commands** repository! This project is a centralized guide for frequently used commands across the most common Operating Systems (OS), Hyper-V, Firewalls, and Network Switches.

The purpose of this repository is to make it easy for IT professionals, system administrators, and network engineers to quickly find and use essential commands, without needing to dig through multiple sources or manuals.

## Structure

The repository is organized into several folders based on the type of platform or technology. Each folder contains a markdown file with a list of the most common and useful commands for that system or device. Here's an overview of the structure:
